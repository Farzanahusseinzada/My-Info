    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am <b>Farzana Hussein Zada</b> who is residing in Quetta, Pakistan. I was interested at technology on my
        childhood era. Fortunately, I succed to reach my dream and enter to computer sience faculty in 
        Mazar-e-sharif, Afghanistan, but I was not able to complete that amazing journey.
    </p>
    <p>
        Almost, I am busy with classes of <b>"CodeToInspire"</b> Graphic Designing and Web Designing; 
        they are not classes for me, I consider them as an entertainment. 
    </p>
    <p>I am about to say: <b>"coding is my everything"</b>, I love coding even its errors.
     I start my journey again which I left it several years ago; so, I want to be one of the best 
     programmer, but after my <b>teachers</b></p>
